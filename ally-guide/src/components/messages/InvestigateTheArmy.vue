      <h1>To whom it may concern,
</h1> <br>
   <p> I am writing to ask that you use your platform to investigate and restore checks and balances of the Army and other Department of Defense operations. Please implore US Senator Ted Cruz to open a congressional investigation into Vanessa Guillen’s disappearance off of the army base in Fort Hood and that her family has support during these trying times. </p> <br>
 <p> U.S. Army investigators confirmed "partial human remains" Tuesday in Leon River, Texas, near where Guillen went missing in April. They did not confirm the body was Guillen's or offer a formal timetable for their "identification process."Just hours later, a suspect in Guillen's case killed himself as law enforcement was closing in. The Killeen Police Department said the suspect was another soldier stationed at Fort Hood who had left his post overnight.
Natalie Khawam, the main attorney within this case has stated multiple times, “The base command did not provide us with the information they promised us. They were not transparent, or forthcoming. We got nothing.” It has been statedd over and over, there is suspected foul play as Guillen’s sexual harassment preceding this has been largely neglected up until her murder.
        </p> <br>
        <p> Congress needs to do its job. The Department of Defense needs to do its job, to truly provide justice to the men and women who voluntarily serve our country and put their lives on the line. Our ask here is an official congressional investigation in parallel with outside investigators into HR practices within the Army along with financial support for Guillens family. </p> <br>
        <p>Sincerely, </p>
