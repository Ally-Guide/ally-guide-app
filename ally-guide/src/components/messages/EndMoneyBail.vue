      <h1>To whom it may concern,
</h1> <br>
   <p> As we’ve seen time and time again, cash bail does not promote safety and unfairly penalizes low-income defendants while those who can afford bail go free. We ask that you join us in the fight to abolish money bail and help bring about long overdue equality within our justice system for black Americans. Prisons are currently overflowing due to poor minorities who were racially profiled and then have access to overworked pro bono officers. Many of these minorities are taken advantage of by moneybail officers, someone’s freedom shouldn’t rest on whether they have the money to buy it.  </p> <br>
 <p>In the current climate as we request the justice system be reevaluated, the least we can do is drop cash bail systems while we protest for our right to organize and demand change.
        </p> <br>
        <p> Tear gas has always been an inhumane method of dispersing protestors and controlling crowds and is an egregious attack on civil liberties and the right to peaceful assembly. However, the use of tear gas--which not only affects the nervous system, but also the pulmonary system-- is especially heinous during the time of a pandemic that weakens lung capacity and strength. Not only has this harmed protestors directly, many have had to remove their PPE (including face masks) to find relief from tear gas, leaving them completely exposed to COVID-19 and other pathogens. Free testing and treatment should be allocated to all. </p> <br>
        <p>Sincerely, </p>
