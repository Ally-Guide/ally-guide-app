   <p>I am writing to ask that you use your platform to bring reform to the policies that inherently advance the erasure of American Indian landmarks and treaties signed to return their land.“This place is very, very sacred to our people,” says Nick Tilsen, president and CEO of the NDN Collective. “Stealing our land and then carving the faces of four white men who were colonizers, who committed genocide against Indigenous people, is an egregious act of violence.”
 </p> <br>
 <p>Historically this has been the site of The Six Grandfathers and a sacred place for the Lakota-Sioux people. President Trumps ‘Freedom’ get together exacerbated the region as thousands descended without proper masks or social distancing protocol. All of this comes as Indian Country has been particularly hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
        </p> <br>
        <p> After years of legal challenges, the Supreme Court in 1980 upheld the Indian Claims Commission's ruling that the taking of the Black Hills was illegal under the Fifth Amendment, based on the fact that 75% of the tribe’s men had not consented to the agreement. We want to echo that we need you to be accountable for reparations beginning with restoring Mount Rushmore to The Six Grandfathers, and providing medical supplies to the tribal governments of Lakota, Rosebud Sioux, Cheyenne River Sioux, and Oglala Sioux tribes</p> <br>
        <p>Sincerely, </p>
