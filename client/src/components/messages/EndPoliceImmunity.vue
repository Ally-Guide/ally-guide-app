  <p>I am writing to demand justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Trayvon Martin, and every other American whose life ended too soon at the hands of the police force. This week, U.S. Congressman Justin Amash, an independent from Michigan, is introducing the "Ending Qualified Immunity Act." This Act will eliminate qualified immunity and restore Americans’ ability to obtain relief when police officers violate their constitutionally secured rights. As Amash has stated, the "Civil Rights Act of 1871 gave individuals the right to sue local and state officials, including police officers, that violate their rights." But in 1967, the Supreme Court began gutting this law by creating the qualified immunity doctrine. The ACLU says "qualified immunity is one of the many barriers standing in the way of justice and accountability when the police use excessive force disproportionately against people of color."</p> <br>
  <p> Government actors should not be held to less of a standard than the general public, they should be held to an even higher standard because of the power they hold. George Floyd's murder is part of a much greater pattern of egregious police misconduct, and until police officers are no longer "legally, politically, and culturally insulated from consequences for violating the rights of the people they are sworn to protect," there can be no end to this pattern. Qualified Immunity is the first step to solving this problem, please sign the “Ending Qualified Immunity Act”. </p>
